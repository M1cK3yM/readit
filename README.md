## 🧐 **What is Readit?**

Welcome to **Readit**, the platform where people come to argue over everything and anything! Inspired by Reddit, but with 50% fewer features and 100% more bugs. Think of us as the *knock-off brand* of Reddit. If Reddit is Coca-Cola, we’re... Cola Xtreme.

## ✨ **Features**  
- 🔥 **Post Stuff**: Share your world-shattering memes, conspiracy theories, or your dog wearing sunglasses.  
- 💬 **Comment Like a Boss**: Tell people they’re wrong in a thread that’s completely off-topic!  
- 👍 **Upvotes & Downvotes**: Because everyone needs validation (or crushing rejection).  
- 🏆 **Customizable Communities**: Create a group for your niche interests like "CatsWearingHats" or "PineapplePizzaApologists."
